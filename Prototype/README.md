# I use this folder for prototyping purpose
This folder is created for prototyping how server and client work but you can also use it for basic socket example.

BASIC
test_server.py   <-- Server
test_client.py   <-- Client

ADVANCED (Not that advance lol)
test_server2.py  <-- Server
test_client2.py  <-- Client
